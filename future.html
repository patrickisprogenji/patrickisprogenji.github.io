<h2>High School And College</h2>
		<p>My High School Choices are Polytechnic and Lakewood High. Poly is where most of my family go so I chose to go there to. Lakewood is close to my house so that is my other choice. I want to go to Washington University because.....<p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>Its A University</li>
			<li>Well, because its in Washington</li>
			</ol>
			
		<h2>Career Interests</h2>
				<p>I only have a few career interests. I want to be a pro gamer because every since I was 5, I have always loved video games so thats why I want to be a pro gamer. Also, since I love games so much, I want to be a game designer. Finally I want to code or program something for a living but I'm not sure who I should work for.</p>
				
		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p>I have a simple goal in life, I just want to live a balanced life. I don't want to be really poor (of course). But I don't want to live a super hard life like being the president. I want to hust live a very easy ongoing life.</p><br><br><br>
