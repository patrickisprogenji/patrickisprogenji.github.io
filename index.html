			<p>I have a decent amount of skills. Most of them have something to do with technology. I am really good a video games, coding, and typing. My other skills include running and football.</p>
			
		<h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
			<p>I don't have many hobbies or interests. I like to play video games on my free time. I also like to sleep when I have nothing to do. If I am not doing any of these things, I am probably on my phone playing a game or watching Youtube. I am in a computer class so I am kinda interested in the stuff that we are learning.</p>
			
			
		<h2>Family</h2>
			<p>I have 6 family members. I have a brother, 2 half brothers, a mother, a father and 2 grandparents. I get along with most of them. We travel a lot and all share the same interests.</p>
